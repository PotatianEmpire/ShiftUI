## Steps on clashing
For every HD (Hit Dice) attack the said number of targets. Said targets have to roll the HD equal to the attackers HD. If the HD is worsened by the target only the target rolls with the worse HD. The HD of the attacker can also be worsened. <br>

### Example
A: spends time to use skill and gains tempo
A: a skill (precision-type) with: 2d4 HD within 1 Meter.
-- first point of communication (important information is the range and number of HD and the dice for HD)
B: choose skills whose HD combined is the same as the attackers number of HD
B: spend necessary time and gain tempo to use the skills
B: in range
-- second point of communication
C: choose skills whose HD combined is the same as the attackers number of HD
C: spend necessary time and gain tempo to use the skills
C: in range
-- third point of communication
D: out of range
-- forth point of communication
B: rolls twice for HD which in this case equals 1 due to being the selected target.
C: rolls twice for HD which in this example equals 1 and 3 since the improvement in HD only applies to player A and B.
A: from previous skill(perception-type): improve HD by 1 against one enemy (target B)
A: rolls twice for HD which in this case equals 1 due to 1d4 improved by 1 is 1d1 which is always equal to 1.
A: rolls for damage. the skill (blunt-type) with: 3 + 1d4 (in the example: 5)
-- fifth point of communication (A annouces the HD values and the damage)
B: rolls for all skills hit (in this case: 2d6 -> 4 and 3 + 1d8 -> 5)
C: rolls for all skills hit (in this case: 1d4 -> 3)
B: since the first skill rolled lower than 5 the attack was successful and the defense was unsuccessful the defense skill is destroyed.
B: the second skill was equal to the attack value and successful at defending.
C: since the defense rolled lower than the attack the defense skill is destroyed.

## Tips

normal actions change the time and tempo values while destroyed actions will not change any of these.
actions of the destroyed actions are always passive.

| action type | rules |
| -- | -- |
| passive defense | if attack value was larger than the passive defense value the attack effect is applied |
| perception | if information type matches with the perception type and the information HD value is within given range an effect is applied to character |
| control | if HD was within the given range and the control value was larger than any opposing value the control effect is applied |
| attack | if HD was within the given range and the attack value was larger than any opposing value the attack effect is applied |
| inflict | if HD was within the given range and the attack value was larger than any opposing value the inflict effect is applied |
| heal | if HD was within the given range and the heal value was larger than any opposing value value the heal effect is applied |
| move | if attackers HD was within the given range and the attack value was larger than the move value the attack effect is applied |
