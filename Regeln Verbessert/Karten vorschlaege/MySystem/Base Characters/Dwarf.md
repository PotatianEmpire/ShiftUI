## stat classification
| level | value range | HD count range | example | info |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| 1 | 1 ~ 5 | ~ 4 | weak human | this is propably what your weakest skill is going to be |
| 2 | 6 ~ 10 | ~ 6 | average human | level 2 skills are very common and also the main skill level in a starter kit |
| 3 | 11 ~ 15 | ~ 8 | strong human | you will propable have 1 or 2 level 3 skills but not very efficient ones |
| 4 | 16 ~ 20 | ~ 10 | average monster | if you are lucky you may get one of these after your first adventure. but focusing on trying to get high level skills are not advised. rather getting support and utility is much more rewarding at this stage |
| 5 | 21 ~ 25 | ~ 12 | strong swordsman | this is going to be your strongest ability you will be building your character around in more advanced battles |
| 6 | 26 ~ 30 | ~ 14 | strong monster | the enemies you are going to be fighting usually top at this level. anything higher is reserved for big bosses |
| 7 | 31 ~ 35 | ~ 18 | saint level swordsman | this is propably the strongest you will ever get |
| 8 | 36 ~ 40 | ~ 25 | calamity level monster | this is propably the strongest enemy you will encounter |
| 9 | 41 ~ 45 | ~ 30 | weak diety | may the powercreep thrive... if you are fighting level 9 you propably f'd up. |
| 10 | 46 ~ 50 | ~ 50 | strongest known magic | you may get to use a level 10 skill once |
| ~ 20 | 51 ~ 100 | ~ 100 | strongest known monster | mostly for lore purposes |
| ~ 40 | 101 ~ 200 | ~ 100 | diety | another lore only |
| ~ 100 | 201 ~ 500 | ~ 100 | strongest observed magic | even more lore |
| ~ 200 | 501 ~ 1000 | ~ $\infty$ | strongest known diety | fun lore |

## tempo gain
| efficiency | range | info |
| -- | -- | -- |
| abismal | -20 ~ -5 | mostly a gimmick on strong bosses, to give them a weakness |
| bad | -4 ~ -2 | you really don't want a skill like this to go to waste |
| normal | -1 ~ 0 | manageable, not good but not bad. most good attack skills will be around here |
| good | +1 | good for maintaining tempo but won't be good as a tempo gain |
| high utility | +2 ~ +3 | great for tempo gain. if the attack level is around level 2 it's a keeper |
| legendary | +4 ~ +5 | yes. keep this. i know tempo is a bit hard to understand but its going to be incredibly useful against powerful opponents. no, its going to be a must for later bosses. |
| broken | +6 ~ +10 | no. im not going to make any of this calibre. |

## things to be considered (for strength)

1. value (also reference level, the higher the better in this case)
2. time cost (the lower the better, also reference tempo gain (calculated time cost - tempo gain))
3. tempo gain (the higher the better, also reference tempo gain)
4. HD count (Hit dice count, the more the better for attack but, less is better for evading and more is better for absorbing attacks)
5. HD value (the lower the better)
6. HD value change (the higher the better)
7. range (the larger the better)
8. type (the rarer the better for defense but bad for receiving buffs)
9. buffs (the more the merrier)
10. conditionals (common types are better)
11. infliction (the more the better, also better with nasty removal effects)
12. control of enemy (the more the better)
13. effects (not all just destroy card some heal and some create weaknesses)
14. sacrificing cards (ok this is just too situational but look at the values to see if its worth it)
15. mana (to reuse magic you need to use mana to heal magic, also consider how many magic skills mana can heal. )
16. effect duration (the longer the better)
17. time advantage (these mostly come from skill that reset tempo, the higher the better)
18. environment control (creating new skill (objects) is good but look at the other values)
19. destruction effects (the less debuffs the better)
20. destroyed actions (some are easier to heal and some are harder)

## balancing
1. it always comes to weighing all the values
2. strong abilities need setting up (the longer and harder the setup the larger the payoff)
3. versitality (being able to do one thing very good is great but can be ineffective against some enemies)
4. chaining (setting up isn't only good for a singular strong skill but can be used to make normal skills very strong)
5. time management (only skills that give tempo is bad just as skills that only cost a lot of time)
6. managing damage (skills that midigate damage is needed for long fights)
7. surprise factor (using unexpected skill combinations is good against most enemies)
8. strong abilities give disadvantage after being used
