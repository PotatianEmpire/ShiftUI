# Positioning
Positioning is a concept in which every [card](./Cards_and_Skills.md) is applied a position from 1 to 4.
The initial position of a card is determined by every player.
The cards have to be ordered into the position in order from 0 to 3.
If all cards from the first position are destroyed the person is eliminated.
The card on top of every position is the only card whose skills can be used in battle and also the card that has to defend against attacks.
Every player is equipped with a sheet in which all four positions are drawn onto.
Everytime when getting hit, a hit dice is rolled which is equal to the attackers [hit dice](#propability-hit-dice).
The value is added to each position of the cards.
Then for matching values it counts as a hit and effects are applied.
# Propability (Hit Dice)
Hit dice range from a d100 to a d1.
d1 counts as a sure hit.
Propabilities can be improved.
Improving propablity works in following order:
d100 -> d60 -> d20 -> d12 -> d10 -> d8 -> d6 -> d4 -> d1
Worsening propability works in the opposite direction.
# Determining position
Moving: Local card position + position modifiers = position
Attack: Local card position + position modifiers = position
## Rounding up and down
2d9 -> 2d8
1d3 -> 1d4
