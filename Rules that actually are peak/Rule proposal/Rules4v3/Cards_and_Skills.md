# Cards
Each card represents a concept be it an object or an emotion.
These cards have somekind of name and description.
Cards serve a story purpose and a game mechanical purpose.
The mechanical purpose is as a vessel for [charges](./New_Mechanic.md/#charge) and [skills](#skill).
A Card can be in two states.
The first is its standard state in which [skills](#skill) are aktive and ready to be used.
The second is its deformed state in which the standard [skills](#skill) are not available.
A card becomes deformed whenever the [charge](./New_Mechanic.md/#charge) goes higher than 6 and then activates a forced discharge.
Only in the deformed state the [charge value](./New_Mechanic.md/#charge) has to be kept track of manually.
For a card to exit its deformed state the [charge](./New_Mechanic.md/#charge) has to be manually reverted to its [skill value](./New_Mechanic.md/#charge).
# Skill
Each card has one or more skill which can be activated under certain conditions such as [time spent](./Time_and_Tempo.md/#time), [tempo](./Time_and_Tempo.md/#tempo), [charge](./New_Mechanic.md/#charge) and [amount discharged](./New_Mechanic.md/#discharge).
These skills manipulate the game within the realms of the mechanics.
Skill may differ from one to the other but are usually designed following a similar design pattern.
That is the skill either consumes or grants [time](./Time_and_Tempo.md/#time) and does the same for [tempo](./Time_and_Tempo.md/#tempo) and creates some kind of effect changing the battle field.
There are a few types of skills which are considered standard.
These skill-types have different kinds of specialization and can be easily differentiated by looking at their value.
Some skills can be multifunctional.
In such case the skill may have a characteristic of one skill-type and that of another different one.
These standard types are listed below and their individual characteristics can be accessed via a link.
