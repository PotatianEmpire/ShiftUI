1. Time and Tempo
2. Hit dice / damage system / energy system
3. Skill / card system

Im just going to take some notes here.

The time and tempo system will just be the one from previous versions.
The biggest change is going to be the damage system.
The skill / card mechanics isn't going to change much but will be made more concise and fit the new additions especially from the damage system.

The underlying philosophy can be expressed by the following formula.
$$ N \triangleq \text{"Event"} \\
a \triangleq \text{"player a"} \\
b \triangleq \text{"player b"} \\
N(a \leftrightarrow b) \\
a \sqcap P \leftrightarrow b \sqcap P
$$
