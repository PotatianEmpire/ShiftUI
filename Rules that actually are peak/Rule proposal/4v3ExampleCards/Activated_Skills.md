# Activated Skills
Activated Skills make use of the [forced discharge](../Rules4v3/Cards_and_Skills.md/#cards) mechanic instead of skills to act.
## Pros
- Replacability.
- Can profit from enemy attacks.
## Cons
- Often one time use only.
- Needs specific a [charge skill](./Charge_Skills.md) to be activated.
- Activation can be countered easily.
