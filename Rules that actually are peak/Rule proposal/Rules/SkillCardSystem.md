# Skill / Card System
## Rules and Foundations
A card has two states. Original / Normal and deformed / destroyed. 
## Theoretical Analysis
A card has two states. Original / Normal and deformed / destroyed. In analysis we use the numerical term deformity to describe this phenomenon. If the deformity is within the interval of 0 and 1 we can simplify it to the card being in its original / normal state. If the deformity is larger than 1 we declare it as deformed / destroyed. Any deformity between 0 and 1 is too unstable of a structure whence it reverts to a deformity of 0 within a at most 1 turn.
## Examples
## Abstract / Reasoning
Every entity / idea / ability / object is represented as a Card. The rules of the game lay foundation for clear cut communication on how one card may affect another. One has to be able to expect certain core behaviours from a card. These core behaviours have to be easily understood and universal.
